<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I've just publish Kevoree 1.8.2 , it contains mainly severals bug fix, in Kevoree M@RShell export , Node bootstrap and many others.</p>
<p>Another great new, we just receive thanks to our friends and collegues from Norway some RaspberryPI board. First tests on kevoree runtime are very impressive. So we will provide a dedicated runtime to support dynamic adaptation on such devices.</p>
<p>Stay tuned &hellip;</p>
