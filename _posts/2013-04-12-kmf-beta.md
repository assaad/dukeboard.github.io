KMF 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT is currently being intensively beta tested. Join the beta-testers team!

The official version will be released before the end of this month. It will include more robust, yet super efficient, serializers and loaders for XMI (Eclipse compatible), as well as for JSON (with a human-readable syntax).

The release of KMF 1.3.0 will in turn trigger the release of Kevoree 2.0, which Francois will tell you more about very soon :-)

Stay tuned!
