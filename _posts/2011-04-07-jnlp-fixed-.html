A special thank you to Apache Felix developpement team wich has fixed the bug introduced by the update number 1.6.0_24 &nbsp;of java virtual machine. Use of OSGi in Java Web Start and Applet is now ok. As a result the last Kevoree (1.1.0-beta1) runtime can now be launched by the JNLP link.<img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5324703543657709-5257979024525805732?l=blog.kevoree.org" height="1" alt="" width="1" />
