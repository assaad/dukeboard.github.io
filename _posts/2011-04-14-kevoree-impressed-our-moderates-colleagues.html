We had a MODERATES project meeting this Wednesday. As usual, we prepared very few slides and mostly relied on live demos... including a demo based on Kevoree, in our brand new show-room (formerly a crappy object-room). Our colleagues were quite impressed by this demo :-)<img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5324703543657709-2059841354164832088?l=blog.kevoree.org" height="1" alt="" width="1" />
