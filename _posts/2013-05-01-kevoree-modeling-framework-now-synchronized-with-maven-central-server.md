title: "Kevoree Modeling Framework now synchronized with Maven Central Server"
category: posts

Hi all,

We just finish the synchronization of Kevoree Modeling Framework with the Maven Central Server.
Now the link with Kevoree Maven repository is not necessary any more.
So user can remove from their pom section like :

	<pluginRepository> â€¦. </pluginRepository> 
	
We also release the 1.3.0-BETA2 version of KMF, which is the first version synchronized with the maven repository.

For maintenance reasons, a tag on our repository will be created in the same manner.

Best regards,
Duke ;-)
