We have release the first beta of Kevoree Modeling Framework : 1.3.0-BETA1.
The final version is planned for delivery before the end of this month so please help to test it and send feedbacks and bugs through the github tracker.

This new version mainly stabilize the Kotlin generator and add the JSON format support.
Last but not last we had some special keywords like "contained". Details can be found in the documentation.
