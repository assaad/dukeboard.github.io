Polymer Framework
=======

Writing optimization processes is a complex task! And it is even more a pain if it must be used at runtime.
This complexity came from different things. Data to manipulate and optimize is often complex and related to technical details.
In addition optimization algorithms such as evolutionary or constraints programming oftenly rely on a problem encoding which require strong knowledges.
However, multi-objective optimization can be very relevant for many case studies. 
As an example it can be the cornerstone of a cloud reasoning engine which tackles the trade-off between performance and cost of your provisioning...
That why we build the polymer framework, in order to allows you to optimize simple your models.

### Ok, what is the main idea?

Data reflect a domain. In order to design a domain people oftenly rely on concepts like schema or modeling.
Modeling has good properties, like offering a navigation layer on top of data, allowing to navigate into data like any object oriented API.
Such API is simple to manipulate and perfectly can reflect a concept, it is as well used a lot at design time to draw complex software. Why not using at runtime to write your optimization process?
However to be super efficient we need effcient tools. That why we build the KMF framework, to have a very efficient modeling layer for runtime usage.
The Polymer framework aims at perform optimization on any KMF compliant model, expressed in MOF concepts, even it must face several conflicting objectives.
Polymer offers state of the art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, and in addition new hyper-heuristic for runtime concerns.
The basic idea it keep it simple...

> Polymer framework is dedicated to perform multi-objective optimization on top of MOF compliant models.
